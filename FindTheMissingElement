An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.


public class FindTheMissingElement {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int arr[] = new int[] { '1', '2', '4', '3', '6' };
		int sum = 0, tSum = 0, missingElement = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			sum = sum + arr[i];
		}
		tSum = arr[arr.length] * arr[arr.length] + 1;
		missingElement = tSum - sum;

		System.out.println("Missing Element is " + missingElement);
	}
}
